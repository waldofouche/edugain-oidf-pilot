## Test Preconditions and Dependencies

| Ref | Area | Preconditions / Dependencies |
|------|------|-------------------------------| 
| **P-01** | Federation Entities | Valid OP and RP federation entity configurations are available, each with correct metadata and signing keys. |
| **P-02** | Trust Anchor Endpoints | The TA exposes `/fetch`, `/list`, and `/resolve` endpoints per OpenID Federation specification. |
| **P-03** | Network & Authentication | All components (TA, OP, RP) can communicate over HTTPS. |
| **P-04** | Trust Marks | Trust mark issuers and validation endpoints are available and reachable. |
| **P-05** | Logging & Monitoring | Logging enabled on TA, OP, and RP components to record enrolment, key, and trust evaluation events. |

|------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **TA-01** | Basic | A single Trust Anchor managing enrolment and trust for one OP and one RP.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **TA-02** | Hierarchical Single-Root | A root Trust Anchor delegates trust to a single intermediate authority, which manages one OP and one RP.                                                                                                                          |
| **TA-03** | Hierarchical Single-Root, Multi-Intermediate | A single Trust Anchor with two intermediate authorities; each intermediate manages its own OP and RP.                                                                                                                             |
| **TA-04** | Hierarchical Multi-Intermediate and Multi-Root | Two Trust Anchors: the first has two intermediates with an OP and RP each; the second has an OP and RP, but the OP also connects to one intermediate from the first Trust Anchor, forming a cross administrative federation link. |
|**RP-01** | Basic | A single RP managing managed by a Trust Anchor                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Noting: TA-01 represents national federation use cases, and TA-02 to TA-04 represent international federation use cases, such as eduGAIN. In addition, TA-05 and TA-06 introduce Trust Mark Issuers to validate trust mark scenarios.

In each test case, the architecture reference (e.g., TA-01) indicates which is the *minimum* topology to use to satisfy the given test—the same test can apply to other topologies.

|--------|------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CR-01**  | TA-01 | MAY               | Explicit Registration             | Support explicit registration                   | RP registers explicitly with OP using `client_secret_basic` | RP receives valid credentials (`client_id`, `client_secret`) and can authenticate |
| **CR-02**  | TA-01 | MUST              | Explicit Registration           | Provide error handling for failed explicit registration | Attempt explicit registration when trust cannot be established | OP returns compliant error response                            |
| **CR-03**  | TA-01 | MUST              | Automatic Registration | Support automatic registration with signed JWT  | RP registers automatically using signed Request Object JWT | RP receives valid authentication response; trust established   |
| **CR-04**  | TA-01 | MUST              | Automatic Registration | Support automatic registration with signed & encrypted JWT | RP registers automatically using signed and encrypted Request Object JWT | RP receives valid authentication response; trust established   |
| **CR-05**  | TA-01 | MUST              | Automatic Registration          | Provide error handling for failed automatic registration | Attempt automatic registration when trust cannot be established | OP terminates flow with error; no redirect to `redirect_uri`   |
| **CR-06**  | TA-02 | MUST              | Automatic Registration | Support automatic registration with hierarchical trust chain | RP registers automatically using signed JWT with hierarchical trust chain | RP receives valid authentication response; trust established through chain |
| **CR-07**  | TA-02 | MUST              | Explicit Registration    | Support explicit registration with hierarchical trust chain | RP registers explicitly using signed JWT with hierarchical trust chain | RP receives valid authentication response; trust established through chain |

## Client Authentication Test Cases

| Ref    | Arch | Requirement Level | Test Name                                      | Requirement Summary                              | Test Action                                              | Expected Outcome                                               |
|--------|------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CA-01**  | TA-01 | MAY              | Endpoint Authentication           | Authenticate clients for `/resolve` endpoint, ensure that access to the resource-intensive and bandwidth-heavy resolution functionality is restricted to authorized clients    | Attempt to access `/resolve` without authentication      | Only authenticated clients can retrieve resolved Entity Statements |
| **CA-02**  | TA-01 | MAY              | Endpoint Authentication             | Authenticate clients for `/fetch` endpoint, ensure that access to the resource-intensive fetch functionality is restricted to authorized clients      | Attempt to access `/fetch` without authentication        | Only authenticated clients can access signed Entity Statements |
| **CA-03**  | TA-01 | MAY              | Endpoint Authentication              | Authenticate clients for `/list` endpoint, prevent enumeration of entities to unauthorized clients       | Attempt to access `/list` without authentication         | Only authenticated clients can retrieve entity lists           |

## Federation Interoperability Test Cases (SAML/OpenID)


| Ref       | Arch | Requirement Level | Test Name                                  | Requirement Summary                                                                             | Test Action                                                                    | Expected Outcome                                                           |
|-----------|------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **FI-01** | RP-01 | MAY              | Relying Party SAML/OpenID Interoperability | A user should be able to login to a service regardless of federation type, and be the same user | Login to RP that is both SAML/OpenID Federated | End-User is the same user to the service, regadless of the authn mechanism |
